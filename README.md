## 🔗 Project Ecosystem & Integration

The **Metaverse** is part of a larger, high-performance educational infrastructure designed for real-time synchronization and tracking:

*   **Simulator Game (Metaverse)**: [https://github.com/aptronics-master/metaverse.git](https://github.com/aptronics-master/metaverse.git)
*   **Learning Management System (Nexus LMS)**: [https://github.com/aptronics-master/nexus.git](https://github.com/aptronics-master/nexus.git)

### 🔄 Nexus LMS & SCORM Synchronization
The Metaverse simulator is fully integrated with **Nexus LMS** for seamless educational tracking and reporting:

*   **SCORM Compliance**: The system leverages **SCORM** (Sharable Content Object Reference Model) standards, or **SCORMing**, to ensure high-fidelity communication between the simulator and the LMS.
*   **Real-time Score Sync**: Every score and performance metric obtained by the user within the **Metaverse** simulator is automatically synchronized and displayed within the **Nexus LMS**.
*   **Performance Monitoring**: Instructors can monitor student progress and performance in real-time, directly from the Nexus dashboard.

## 📖 How to Use

1.  **Launch**: Set `LoginLevel` as your startup map in Project Settings.
2.  **Logic**: The system communicates with AWS via REST API calls. On success, it returns tokens which can be stored in a `GameInstance` or `SaveGame` for session management and LMS sync.
3.  **Customization**: All UI elements are standard UMG widgets. Design can be modified in the `Content` folder.
